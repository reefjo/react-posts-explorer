# Overview
This project is a React-based application designed to fetch and display posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
It is built with a focus on scalability, modularity, and maintainability using React hooks, and follows best practices to ensure clean, maintainable code.

# Features
*  Fetching Data: Displays posts retrieved from the JSONPlaceholder API.
*  Author Filtering: Allows users to filter posts by author.
*  Sorting: Sorts posts by different criteria for enhanced user experience.
*  Pagination: Implements pagination to efficiently load and display a large set of posts.
*  Interactive Map: Integrated React-Leaflet for displaying postsâ€™ random coordinates on a map.
*  Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes using CSS and React components.



# How It Works
*  Fetching Data: Upon loading, the app makes an HTTP request to the JSONPlaceholder API to retrieve a list of posts.
*  Author Filtering: Users can filter posts by the author's name using a dropdown menu.
*  Sorting: Posts can be sorted based on title or body content.
*  Pagination: The posts are paginated to improve performance and readability.
*  Interactive Map: Random coordinates for each post are displayed on a map using React-Leaflet, providing geographical context.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
